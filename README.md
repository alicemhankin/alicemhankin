Hi! I'm Alice Hankin and my pronouns are she/her âœ¨

Here is where I keep the projects I have worked on as a statistics student at the University of Auckland.

My coolest visualisations are for [the saddlepoint approximation](saddlepoint.shinyapps.io/visualise) and [branching processes](https://alicemh.shinyapps.io/multitype_2/). These were both produced in R Shiny and I'd love you to check them out.

I am most proud of my masters dissertation found [here]() - this details the development of the saddlepoint visualisation application. My honours project found [here]() details how I used high performance computing and Bayesian models to model terrorism events in Iraq.
